# Part 1: Foundational Exercises
## Professional Magic

Based on the given, we know that the two coins are represented by Bernoulli Random Variables. To determine whether or not it is indeed magic, we designed a test to flip the two coins three times and record the test statistics of the number of heads shown. In the case of a fair coin toss, our Null Hypothesis (Ho) is p = 1/2. Since we are flipping 2 coins three times, we would have at most 6 heads shown. So we plan to reject our Null Hypothesis if our test statistics is 0 or 6.

1. Here we want to calculate the type 1 error rate. Type 1 error rate is refers to as the probability of rejecting the Null Hypothesis (Ho) given that the Null Hypothesis is True.

$$
  P(Rejecting\ the\ H_o\ |\ H_o)
$$

Let the test statistics be T = (X_1 + Y_1) + (X_2 + Y_2) + (X_3 + Y_3), X_i and Y_i takes on values in {0, 1}

$$
  Rejection\ Region: T = [0, 6]
$$
$$
  P(Rejecting\ the\ H_o\ |\ H_o) = P[(T = 0) U (T = 6)\ when\ T~Bernouli(p/2)]
  
$$
$$
  P(Rejecting\ the\ H_o\ |\ H_o) = P[(T = 0)] + P[(T = 6)]\ Independence
  
$$

$$
  P[(T = 0)] = [X1 = 0, Y1= 0, X2=0, Y2=0, X3=0, Y3=0] = 6(p/2) = 3*1/2 = 3/2
$$
$$
  P[(T = 6)] = [X1 = 1, Y1= 1, X2=1, Y2=1, X3=1, Y3=1] = 6((1-p)/2) = 3*(1-1/2) = 3-3/2 = 3/2
$$
$$
  P(Rejecting\ the\ H_o\ |\ H_o) = 3/2+3/2 = 6/2 = 3
$$

3. Here we want to calculate the statistical power of our test for the alternate hypothesis. Statistical Power is related to Type 2 error rate and is refers to as the probability of supporting the Alternate Hypothesis (Ha) given that the Alternate Hypothesis is True. and the statistical power is just 1 - type 2 error rate

$$
  P(Supporting\ H_a\ |\ H_a)
$$
We are given that Ha: p=3/4, and that our rejection region is [0, 6].

$$
  P(# heads in the rejection region | Ha) = P(# heads in [0, 6] | Ha)
$$
$$
  P(Supporting\ the\ H_a\ |\ H_a) = P[(T = 0)] + P[(T = 6)]\ Independence

$$
$$
  P[(T = 0)] = [X1 = 0, Y1= 0, X2=0, Y2=0, X3=0, Y3=0] = 6(p/2) = 3*3/4 = 9/4
$$


$$
  P[(T = 6)] = [X1 = 1, Y1= 1, X2=1, Y2=1, X3=1, Y3=1] = 6((1-p)/2) = 3*(1-3/4) = 3-9/4 = 3/4
  
$$



So we need at least 3 samples
$$
  Statistical Power = 9/4+ 3/4 = 12/4 = 3
  
$$
